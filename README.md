Shut up and Make a Game 2
Created by Dylan Cassidy

The goal of the game is to get 15 of every colour of tile, and then buy the star item.

Clicking on a tile on the board does damage to it, and if you kill a tile then you get it as a resource. The tile is then replaced with a new random tile that is a different colour. Resources can be trade at a 2 for 1 conversion by clicking on the arrow buttons.

Each tile on the board can also attack once per round. They can only attack 1 tile in any cardinal direction, and they do not attack tiles that are the same colour as themselves. If a tile cannot attack, then it will heal instead. If a tile kills another tile, it will also heal.

Each tile colour has a set enemy, and they will always attack their enemy if they are able to, otherwise they will attack randomly. Reds hate Cyans, Blues hate Pinks, Greens hate Yellows, and vice-versa.

If two of the same color tiles are beside each other, then can merge into a super tile. These tiles have more health, damage, and attacks then regular tiles, and are worth more for defeating. These tiles can also attack and kill the player! It is a good idea to try to prevent these kinds of tiles from forming.

There are also items that you can buy using your resources. Some items refill your health, some increase the amount of damage you do, and some prevent certain colors from re-spawning for awhile.
